# Deep_learning_for_android_malware_detection
Effectiveness of additional training of an ANN based model in detectining android malware.

**The goal of this project is to show the weakness of an ANN based malware detection model in detecting adversarial samples and how to boost its performance.**


*In this project, I build an ANN based andriod malware detection model. It is trained and tested on data extracted from both benign and malware samples.*

*Using a GAN, we generate adversarial malware samples that we use to attack the model.*
*To boost the model's performance, we retrain it using adversarial samples.*


# ----------Content Description--------------------------

**Feature_Extraction_&_Selection--Dir**

In *Feature_Selection folder*, we have we do feature selection with get_important_features.py and generated final dataset with script3_create_final_combined_dataset_important_features.py.

*Bfeatures_jsons.json*--contains data for 3090 benign samples analysed.

*Mfeatures_jsons.json*--contains data for 3090 malware samples analysed.

*M_Bfeatures_jsons.json*---combined raw data for all samples(Benign and Malware).

*script2_create_combined_dataset_all_features.py* --for generating dataset with all features for each sample(observation).
